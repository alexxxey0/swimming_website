                <h2>What is swimming?</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Swimming</strong> is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of one's
                    entire body to move through water. The sport takes place in pools or open water (e.g., in a sea or
                    lake). Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports, with varied distance events
                    in butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley. In addition to these
                    individual events, four swimmers can take part in either a freestyle or medley relay. A medley relay
                    consists of four swimmers who will each swim a different stroke, ordered as backstroke,
                    breaststroke, butterfly and freestyle.

                    Swimming each stroke requires a set of specific techniques; in competition, there are distinct
                    regulations concerning the acceptable form for each individual stroke. There are also regulations on
                    what types of swimsuits, caps, jewelry and injury tape that are allowed at competitions. Although it
                    is possible for competitive swimmers to incur several injuries from the sport, such as tendinitis in
                    the shoulders or knees, there are also multiple health benefits associated with the sport.

                    In competitive swimming, four major styles have been established. These have been relatively stable
                    over the last 30–40 years with minor improvements. They are: <span id="learn-more"><em>(click to

                <h2>Competition pools</h2>
                <p>
                    World Championship pools must be 50 metres (160 ft) (long course) long and 25 metres (82 ft) wide,
                    with ten lanes labelled zero to nine (or one to ten in some pools; zero and nine (or one and ten)
                    are usually left empty in semi-finals and finals); the lanes must be at least 2.5 metres (8.2 ft)
                    wide. They will be equipped with starting blocks at both ends of the pool and most will have
                    Automatic Officiating Equipment, including touch pads to record times and sensors to ensure the
                    legality of relay takeovers. The pool must have a minimum depth of two metres.

                    Other pools which host events under FINA regulations are required to meet some but not all of these
                    requirements. Many of these pools have eight, or even six, instead of ten lanes and some will be 25
                    metres (82 ft) long, making them Short course. World records that are set in short course pools are
                    kept separate from those set in long course pools because it may be an advantage or disadvantage to
                    swimmers to have more or less turns in a race.

                <h2>Officials</h2>
                <h3 id="officials-list-heading">There are several types of officials, which are needed to manage the
                    competition:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Referee</h3>
                        <p>
                            The referee has full control and authority over all officials. The referee will enforce all
                            rules and decisions of FINA and shall have the final answer to all questions relating to the
                            actual conduct of anything regarding the meet, as well as the final settlement of which is
                            not otherwise covered by the rules. The referee takes overall responsibility for running the
                            meet and makes the final decisions as to who wins each race. Referees call swimmers to the
                            blocks with short blasts of their whistles. This is the signal for the swimmers to stand
                            next to their blocks. Then the referee will blow a long whistle that will tell the swimmers
                            to step on the block. For backstroke events, the long whistle is the signal for the swimmers
                            to jump into the water. The referee will then blow another long whistle, signalling the
                            swimmers to grab the gutter or the provided block handle. Finally the referee will hand over
                            the rest to the starter by directing their hand to the starter.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Starter</h3>
                        <p>
                            The starter has full control of the swimmers from the time the referee turns the swimmers
                            over to them until the race commences. A starter begins the race by saying, "Take your
                            mark." At this point, the swimmers will get into stationary positions in which they would
                            like to start their race. After all swimmers have assumed their stationary position, the
                            starter will push a button on the starting system, signaling the start of a race with a loud
                            noise (usually a beep or a horn) and flash from a strobe light. A starter sends the swimmers
                            off the blocks and may call a false start if a swimmer leaves the block before the starter
                            sends them. A starter may also choose to recall the race after the start for any reason or
                            request the swimmers to "stand", "relax" or "step down" if they believe that (a) particular
                            swimmer(s) has gotten an unfair advantage at the start.

                    <li>
                        <h3>Clerk of course</h3>
                        <p>
                            The clerk of course (also called the "bullpen") assembles swimmers prior to each event, and
                            is responsible for organizing ("seeding") swimmers into heats based on their times. Heats
                            are generally seeded from slowest to fastest, where swimmers with no previous time for an
                            event are assumed to be the slowest. The clerk of the course is also responsible for
                            recording and reporting swimmers who have chosen to "scratch" (not swim) their events after
                            they have signed up or qualified to a semifinal or final. The clerk is also responsible for
                            enforcing rules of the swim meet if a swimmer chooses to not show up ("No show" - NS) to
                            their events.

                        <h3>Timekeepers</h3>
                        <p>
                            Each timekeeper takes the time of the swimmers in the lane assigned to them. Unless a video
                            backup system is used, it may be necessary to use the full complement of timekeepers even
                            when automatic officiating equipment is used. A chief timekeeper assigns the seating
                            positions for all timekeepers and the lanes for which they are responsible. In most
                            competitions there will be one or more timekeepers per lane. In international competitions
                            where full automatic timing and video placing equipment is in use timekeepers may not be
                            required.

                        <p>
                            Inspectors of turns: One inspector of turns is assigned to one or more lanes at each end of
                            the pool. Each inspector of turns ensures that swimmers comply with the relevant rules for
                            turning, as well as the relevant rules for start and finish of the race. Inspectors of turns
                            shall report any violation on disqualification reports detailing the event, lane number, and
                            the infringement delivered to the chief inspector of turns who will immediately convey the
                            report to the referee.

                            Judges of stroke are located on each side of the pool. They follow the swimmers during their
                            swim back and forth across the pool. They ensure that the rules related to the style of
                            swimming designated for the event are being observed, and observe the turns and the finishes
                            to assist the inspectors of turns.

                            Finish judges determine the order of finish and make sure the swimmers finish in accordance
                            with the rules (two hands simultaneously for breaststroke and butterfly, on the back for
                            backstroke, etc.)

                        <strong>Michael Fred Phelps II</strong> (born June 30, 1985) is an American former competitive
                        swimmer. He is the most successful and most decorated Olympian of all time with a total of 28
                        medals. Phelps also holds the all-time records for Olympic gold medals (23), Olympic gold medals
                        in individual events (13), and Olympic medals in individual events (16). When Phelps won eight
                        gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Games, he broke fellow American swimmer Mark Spitz's 1972 record
                        of seven first-place finishes at any single Olympic Games. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in
                        Athens, Phelps already tied the record of eight medals of any color at a single Games by winning
                        six gold and two bronze medals. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Phelps won four gold and
                        two silver medals, and at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, he won five gold medals
                        and one silver. This made him the most successful athlete of the Games for the fourth Olympics
                        in a row.
